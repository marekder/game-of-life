# Game of Life in JavaScript.

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.

One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

# Rules

1.  Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives,
2.  Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell,
3.  All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

## Examples of patterns
